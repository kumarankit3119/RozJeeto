    ABOUT REPEATEDLY PLAYING AUDIO
    ---------------------------
    A. Using audio file:
    ---------------------
    1. The trick to play over and over the same (short) audio is to create more than 1 "Audio" object. Then repeat the play() invocation for each different object.
    2. Or use 1 object, attach a listener (ended event), then chain that to your other trigger if the app something stuff nanana. This one is less efficient. You'll have no "buffer".
    ---------------------
    B. Using web audio API:
    ---------------------
    Synthesize it using web audio API. That takes superposition of multifrequency, phase and oscillation types and maybe filter(s) to mimic the ticking sound. Boy that's something.
